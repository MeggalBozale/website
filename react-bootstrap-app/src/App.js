          the site will host demos for a variety of projects I have worked on over the years, along with some posts of those {"\n"}
          which may not have demonstrations to use. {"\n"}

          computers since I was young, and ever since I have spent my days tinkering, experimenting, and learning. I hope to show off{"\n"}
