          Hello! This is my (MeggalBozale)'s portfolio site. This site is built using React on a remote-hosted server.<br></br>
          This site is currently under construction, primarily in the design phase. Once construction is complete, <br></br>
          the site will host demos for a variety of projects I have worked on over the years, along with some posts of those <br></br>
          which may not have demonstrations to use. <br></br>
          <a href="https://github.com/MeggalBozale/Goonstation_Gizmos">Goonstation Gizmos</a><br></br><br></br>

          I am currently a student entering college, looking to pursue my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I've been enthralled by<br></br>
          computers since I was young, and ever since I have spent my days tinkering, experimenting, and learning. I hope to show off<br></br>
          a bunch of cool stuff to the world over time, so stay tuned!
